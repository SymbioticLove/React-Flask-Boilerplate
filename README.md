<h1>Basic React Front-End with Flask Back-End Boilerplate</h1>
This is a boilerplate template for a React web application running a Flask back-end. The batch file in the "shortcuts" directory will (assuming that the repo is installed at your C: drive) navigate to the project, download the necessary dependencies (Flask, Flask-cors, npm), deactivate the virtual environment, start up the flask server, and then start up the React server.

React/Flask is a lightweight and versatile approach to web development. Combined, they can be used for almost any application. Flask is easy to use, allowing developers to have intricate control over the structure of applications and components. Flask has limitations when it comes to larger applications, so if you're looking for a massive and robust back-end, you should instead look to Django, which is more on-par with React in modularity and scalability.

Everything is already proxied and ready to go as long as you are running ports 3000/5000. Happy coding!
