<h1>Basic React Front-End with Flask Back-End Boilerplate</h1>
This is a boilerplate template for a React web application running a Flask back-end. The batch file in the "shortcuts" directory will (assuming that the repo is installed at your C: drive) navigate to the project, create and activate a virtual environment named env, download the necessary dependencies (Flask and Flask-cors), deactivate the virtual environment, start up the flask server, and then start up the React server.

Everything is already proxied and ready to go as long as you are running ports 3000/5000! Happy coding!
